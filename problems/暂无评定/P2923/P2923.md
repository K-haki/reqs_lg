## 题目描述
The cows have taken up the game of checkers with a vengeance.

Unfortunately, despite their unlimited enjoyment of playing, they are terrible at the endgame and want your help.

Given an NxN (4 &lt;= N &lt;= 500) checkboard, determine the optimal set of moves (i.e., smallest number of moves) to end the game on the next move. Checkers move only on the '+' squares and capture by jumping 'over' an opponent's piece in the traditional way. The piece is removed as soon as it is jumped.  See the example below where N=8:

```cpp
- + - + - + - +  The K's mark Bessie's kings; the o's represent the 
+ - + - + - + -  opponent's checkers. Bessie always moves next. The 
- + - K - + - +  Kings jump opponent's checkers successively in any 
+ - + - + - + -  diagonal direction (and removes pieces when jumped). 
- o - o - + - + 
+ - K - + - + -  For this board, the best solution requires the lower 
- o - + - + - +  left King to jump successively across all three of the 
+ - K - + - K -  opponents' checkers, thus ending the game (moving K marked as &gt;K&lt;): 
Original          After move 1       After move 2        After move 3 
- + - + - + - +     - + - + - + - +    - + - + - + - +     - + - + - + - + 
+ - + - + - + -     + - + - + - + -    + - + - + - + -     + - + - + - + - 
- + - K - + - +     - + - K - + - +    - + - K - + - +     - + - K - + - + 
+ - + - + - + -     + - + - + - + -    + -&gt;K&lt;- + - + -     + - + - + - + - 
- o - o - + - +     - o - o - + - +    - + - o - + - +     - + - + - + - + 
+ - K - + - + -    &gt;K&lt;- K - + - + -    + - K - + - + -     + - K -&gt;K&lt;- + - 
- o - + - + - +     - + - + - + - +    - + - + - + - +     - + - + - + - + 
+ -&gt;K&lt;- + - K -     + - + - + - K -    + - K - + - K -     + - K - + - K - 

The moves traversed these squares: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8           R C 
1 - + - + - + - +    start: 8 3 
2 + - + - + - + -    move:  6 1 
3 - + - K - + - +    move:  4 3 
4 + - * - + - + -    move:  6 5 
5 - o - o - + - + 
6 * - K - * - + - 
7 - o - + - + - + 
8 + - K - + - K - 
```
Write a program to determine the game-ending sequence for an NxN input board if it exists. There is at least a king and at least one opponent piece on the board. The king can jump a piece on every move of the optimal solution.

## 输入输出格式
#### 输入格式

\* Line 1: A single integer: N

\* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains N characters (each one of: '-', '+', 'K', or 'o') that represent row i of a proper checkboard. Line 2 always begins with '-'.

#### 输出格式

\* Lines 1..?: If there is no winning sequence of jump, output

'impossible' on a line by itself. If such a sequence exists, each line contains two space-separated integers that represent successive locations of a king whose moves will win the game. Any such sequence is acceptable.
